# Python_ND_monte_carlo
```python
p=IsingND(Ls,Ks,A)
```
where Ls and Ks must be python tuple, even it is one dimension, it should be written as (32,)  
Ls is the system dimension  
Ks is the nearest coupling  
A is the longer range coupling in Ls[0] dimension

## 1-d monte carlo 

```python
from MONTECARLO import IsingND
p=IsingND((32,),(1.0,),0.5)
p.run("somename.hdf5",200,1000,1)
```
    
    1 is gap step
    1000 is group step
    200 is group numbers
    total 1000x200x1 steps
    
## 2-d monte carlo    
```python
from MONTECARLO import IsingND
p=IsingND((32,32),(0.2,0.2),0.1)
p.run("somename2.hdf5",50,200,6)
```
    in this case there are 500x200x6 steps running
    but only 500x200 is stored, because the step gap is 6
    
## what is the output?
the output is a hdf5 format file\
